# Rayon

Rayon is a linear quantum optical simulator in Mathematica. 

It can handle beam splitters and squeezers currently. But extending to other
components is trivial.

A modern high-end computer can currently handle a 4 beam setup easily. I have
not been very successful with running 8 beam setups, especially with lots of 
squeezers.

The program is in primitive shape currently. At some point in the future I hope
to provide it as a Mathematica package.

You need at least Mathematica 9 to run it.
